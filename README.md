### Scalatra demo at Scalar Mini, April 23rd, Poznan

This is demo app from the talk I gave on Scalar Mini in Poznan. This is based on great scalatra-sbt-prototype stuff.

1. Launch [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/)

2. Run the standalone app from SBT (call `~reStart` from within SBT shell to trigger app restart on file change)

3. Go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

4. Learn more at [http://scalatra.org](http://scalatra.org)

5. Happy hacking!
